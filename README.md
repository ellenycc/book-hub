BookHub is a book discovery web app that allows users find new and interesting books to read.

### Built with

- React.js
- TypeScript
- Google Book API
- Zustand - React state management library
- Chakra UI - Simple, modular and accessible component library

### Lessons learned

As my first solo React project, I applied the knowledge gained from the various React courses and tutorials that I've gone through. Through this, I have strengthened my foundations in React, particularly understanding the principle of single responsibility and component-based architecture.

Initially, I struggled in prop passing and how to properly structure the app, leading to a cluttered components. Once the core functionality was working, I refactored the code to enhance modularity. For example, I extracted data fetching logic into a custom hook to simplify component logic and make the components more resuable.

Additional takeways include:

- Form-based data fetching: Implementing data retrieval through form submissions.
- State management exploration: Evaluating options like React Query, Context, and Zustand.
- UI library integration: Utilising Chakra UI for efficient component styling.
- Employing React Router for navigation and component rendering based on URLs.
